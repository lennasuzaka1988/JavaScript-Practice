// Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages.
// Messages sent by client, usually web browser: requests
// Messages sent by server: responses
// HTTP is the language itself


// Syntax:
// GET
// POST
// PUT
// DELETE


// GET: Get HTML file
// POST: Post something (data) to server or database
// PUT: Send data and update already existing data
// DELETE: Delete data on server/database


// FETCH on demand objects called Ajax


// Data added after html, begins with ?: query string
// Query string parameters to help with GET


// Send info to the body: POST
// Add form data to server: POST
// Get no query strings but instead form data
// CHECK VIA NETWORK TAB


// HTTPS disallows passwords from being seen when GET or POST. Communication is encrypted between client and server

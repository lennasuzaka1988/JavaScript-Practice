live-server is a great local tester for all files
lodash (so much easier)
To import (legacy?) use browserify and create a bundle doing:
browserify script.js > bundle.js
then follow instructions represented in the script.js file

semver - semantic versioning
- Or the version number of the dependency

In the case of version ^4.17.4, the rightmost number is Patch release for bug fixes. Minor is mid, new features.

package.json is great because you don't have to insert the scripts for all the dependencies in HTML. Just use the bundle script.
Just never upload the nodes to Github

To download the dependencies from the package.json:
npm install

Another type of dependency:
dev dependency = Packages that are only needed for developing and testing

To initiate a particular package from JSON file:
npm run test

To make it easier to continuously update bundle via browserify:
In the package.json

"scripts": {
    "build": "browser"
}

How to upgrade packages:
npm update
npm update -g (globally)

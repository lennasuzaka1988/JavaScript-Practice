In json package, you'll want to upgrade the project but only to minor release. Add karat (^) in front of
version in json file if upgrading to minor or for major use greater than (>)

Then run npm audit fix and force

Could just also change the version (after looking at the current version on the package's website) so instead:
"^16.0.1"
to
"^17.0.2"
and run npm install again

Then npm audit
Then push the change to github
